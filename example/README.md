=== Setup Instructions

Create a new directory for the meimei client. 
You can look at start.rb to see how you could 
connect to a server and different channels.
To actually start the bot, run:

  bundle exec start.rb

You could run it with nohup to run it in the
background.

To install the default set of plugins, you'll
have to check out:

  git clone https://github.com/r888888888/meimei-plugins.git plugins
